# Chess Neural Network Model 

## Introduction:
The game of chess known as the oldest game of history, presented in 7th century in the old texts. What makes this game so attractive is the complexity of analyzing moves and able to see the few moves upfront your opponent. 
The history with computer chess started in 18th century only after a thousand years after invented. There are many approaches when we talk about computer and chess, naÃ¯ve implementation would be alpha beta algorithm with declaring depth parameter which suffers from computation limit. Newer approach presented as DeepChess aiming to solve the game by using Deep Learning approach.
The approach presented in DeepChess is dedicated to choose between position 1 to position 2 by given 2 positions. They trained Pos2Vec model which aims to learn representation of the board and siamise model to evaluate two positions and score who is better.

## Suggested Approach
Seems like Pos2Vec did quite good job in representing the board, Instead of evaluating between two positions, evaluate with N number of moves.
For each position generate N top moves, for my experiment I chose N=30 which seems to be reasonably decent number as most of the time number of legal moves is lower. For generating the N top moves I used Stockfish engine, for testing I will use legal_moves method from chess python library.
The suggested network Encode the board presentation with BoardObs outputs vector of 100 neurons, then pass it to MoveBlock which takes all generated possible moves, pass it through BoardObs. Then input from current board and next board concatenated and inserted to the network. The motivation is to link between current position to next position to understand both positions in one layer.
For base model training I add extra layer 100->1 and y label it with position score evaluation.
The evaluation of MoveBlock would be N scores per move, the scores must be normalized. I chose MSE loss function to minimize the error to match the score.
The database I used is "Lichess rated games  2400+ elo".

## Model architecture
### Base observation model

### Move model

## Preparing the data
For base board observation understanding model I picked 5M random board observations with their score, added extra layer to provide the model score and able to 
train compared real board evaluation score which is simple to calculate.
In MoveBlock this last layer should be removed because we need the output of board representation.
To prepare base model data I created score calculation per board position and run on all the database.

The MoveBlock model data is more harder to provide as need to provide for each position N top moves.
That leads to compute time of ~7 seconds per position which takes alot of time to prepare.
This may improve in the future and might be related to the number of moves (equals N)
Such behaviour can act like reinforcement learning which agent each move evaluate his options and learn each position.

## Training phase
To train base model need to provide databse of board fen representation and their scores to train function in chess_main.
To train move model the current support method is "live" feeding which doing all position move evaluation in runtime, this may be improved in the closed future.
Note that live feeding is not efficient as it wasting gpu time for cpu bottle neck.
